# Models

This folder contains all of the models that were developed during the project. Note that the weights files ('best_model.h5') have not been included in this repository due to their large file sizes. Therefore, you will need to download the complete models from the Google Drive folder.

## general_models/

Contains models trained on datasets where the majority of ants in a frame have been labelled, regardless of their location or activity.

## leaf_tip_models/

Contains models trained on datasets where only ants that are pulling on the leaf tip have been labelled.
