# Leaf-tip models

These models were trained using datasets where only ants pulling on the leaf tip were labelled to assess the best possible accuracy that could be obtained for a model in this scenario.

Note that these models were used for accuracy measurement using cross-validation and hence the centroid and centred instances use the same configurations across folds. The only difference between models of the same type is which frames were used for training and validation.
